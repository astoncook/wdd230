                <h3>Big Top Candy Shop</h3>
                <p> Big Top Candy Shop has been open since October 2007. Decked out in antique circus memorabilia and dubbed “The Most Amazing Candy
                    Store the World has Ever Known,” This was my favorite place to go as a kid. This is a great place to go and explore the austin culture
                    first handed. This is a great perspective on downtown.

                <h3>Brother Friend</h3>
                <p> This this a local clothing company. They are located in the heart of downtown Austin.
                    This company is very nice to shop with. Thier pieces are more minimalistic, but for some
                    that is a very clean and trendy style.

                <h3>A-List Embroidery</h3>
                <p> This buissness is a staple in the everyday working person in the city. Having a good quality
                    emroidered shirt is a must with advertizing a buissness, making a custom design, or even
                    trying something new with style.

                <h3>Garden Seventeen</h3>
                <p> Garden Seventeen is a one-stop greenhouse and garden store similar to Home Depot.
                    The average customer will spend more money here, but the local family feel and small buissness is a great
                    enviornment to be and spend time in. They empower people to do DIY projects and spend time making seomthing they
                    are proud of.

                <h3>Couch Potato ATX</h3>
                <p> This company is very special. We see big companies like Walmart doing dilivery orders and things of that nature,
                    but this company was one of the first to do it. You can order snacks and beverages from their website and get them delivered
                    to your door the same day. This buissness is a great one to support through these changing times.

                <h3>South Congress Partyland</h3>
                <p> This buissness is very essential for the person who has to plan or decorate for a birthday party.
                    I have been before and they have a very big selection of decorations and different themes ranging from clowns to princesses.
                    This business has been around for a long time, but sadly doesnt have a website or a logo I can share.

                <h3>Sun & Ski Sports</h3>
                <p> This buissness is very important to a lot of people that are preparing for vacations or are hoping for a snowy winter here.
                    Last year it snowed a lot down south, so a lot of people ar ebuying more snow gear for down here. I like this buissness because
                    it helps people prepare for future vacations or fun things like bikes and other outdoor accessories.
